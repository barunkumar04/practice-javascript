## Documentations

1. Specification - https://tc39.es/ecma262/

## To revist

1. Javascript execution and code contest
2. Object destructure

## Spread operator (dot dot dot)
1. Written as '...'
2. Very useful and accepted in merging array and object. Refer corresposing js files for more

## Rest operator (dot dot dot again)
1. This is also written as '...'
2. Uses is same as varargs of java.
3. I.e. used as function parameter which can accept any numuber of arguments of same type

## Scope - Local and Global
